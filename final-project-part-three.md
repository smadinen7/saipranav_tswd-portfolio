# The final data story
✅ [View the final story here](https://preview.shorthand.com/kY1uY6TfQLl0o8St)

This final data story explores the shifting dynamics of AI adoption and the corresponding global layoffs it has triggered across industries.  
It presents both the opportunities and hidden costs of this transition through a compelling sequence of visualizations, narrative insights, and real-world data.

# Changes made since Part II
In Part II, only basic graphs were included with one or two lines of insights attached to them.  
Since then, the project has evolved into a fully narrated story with smooth transitions, added context, and engaging visuals.  
The Shorthand project is now complete, tying the visuals together into a structured and insightful narrative.

If more time were available, additional analysis was planned, including scraping data from X (formerly Twitter) to understand public sentiment from individuals impacted by AI-driven job changes.

# The audience
The audience includes:
- Students at Carnegie Mellon University from various fields such as design, entertainment, technology, and policy.
- The course professor evaluating the project.
  
All audience members are, in some way, impacted by the shifts in AI-related jobs, whether through direct career opportunities, industry transformations, or broader societal trends.

The story was shaped to be accessible, engaging, and meaningful to this academic and early-career audience.

# Final design decisions
Key design decisions:
- Shifted from a graph-insight format to a true story arc: starting with the AI boom, exposing hidden disruptions, and ending with adaptation strategies.
- Balanced text-heavy and visual-heavy sections to maintain flow and engagement.
- Added quick highlight points alongside charts to surface important takeaways instantly.
- Selected impactful, relevant imagery (e.g., robot-business handshake, empty offices, garage vs. skyscraper) to emotionally anchor each section.
- Concluded with actionable suggestions to encourage the audience to future-proof their careers.

Working through the process highlighted the importance of **narrative pacing** — knowing when to pause for insight and when to move swiftly through visual storytelling.

# References
References are included directly within the Shorthand story under each relevant visualization and at the end of the story.

# AI acknowledgements
AI tools such as ChatGPT were used to:
- Refine text phrasing and improve narrative transitions.
- Suggest highlight points for graphs.
- Recommend suitable image ideas for different sections.

All analysis, design, and final project assembly were completed independently.

# Final thoughts
This project reinforced the importance of **storytelling in data visualization** — not just presenting information, but making the journey through the information engaging and meaningful.  

If more time had been available, it would have been exciting to enhance the project with scraped public sentiment analysis from social media platforms to complement the quantitative insights with qualitative perspectives.
