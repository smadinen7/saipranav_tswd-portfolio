# Outline

## Project Summary  
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved from a futuristic concept to something that’s already affecting our daily lives — especially in the workplace. For my final project, I’ll explore the impact of AI on the job market. This includes how AI is automating certain job roles, which industries are being most affected, and what new job opportunities are emerging as a result.

Rather than taking a general approach, I want to tell a focused story on how AI is *reshaping* — not just *replacing* — jobs. The goal is to create a clear and engaging narrative, supported by data, that helps the audience understand what’s really happening with AI and employment.

## Project Structure (Story Arc from *Good Charts*)

- **Introduction**: Show how AI is becoming more common across industries. Include stats about adoption and how it’s not just a “tech” thing anymore.
- **Build-up**: Highlight the rise in AI tools at work and how some job tasks are already being automated.
- **Tension**: Show the conflict — jobs are being lost due to AI (especially repetitive roles), but at the same time, AI-related jobs are growing. 
- **Turning Point**: Explain how workers and companies can adapt by learning new skills and redesigning work.
- **Resolution**: Offer a conclusion that AI doesn’t necessarily “take jobs” — it changes what work looks like, and the best way forward is through adaptation.

### One-Sentence Summary  
AI is transforming the job market by automating some roles while creating new ones, and we need to prepare for this shift.

### Target Users  
- Early-career professionals choosing paths  
- Policy makers and educators designing programs  
- Anyone curious about how AI will affect their job

## Initial sketches

> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

![Initial Sketch](./images/plan.png)  

Planned visualizations:
1. **Bar Chart** – AI adoption by industry (e.g., marketing, healthcare, education)
2. **Timeline** – When AI-related job cuts started appearing in layoff reports
3. **Side-by-Side Bars** – Jobs lost vs. jobs gained
4. **Scatter Plot** – Job exposure to AI vs. salary (e.g., “Data Entry Keyers” vs. “Barbers”)
5. **Stacked Bars** – How workers feel about AI (helpful/harmful/neutral)

# The data

For this project, I’ve selected datasets that provide deep insight into the current and projected impact of AI on the workforce. These sources include detailed occupational risk assessments, industry adoption trends, and actual job market data.

| Name | URL | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| AI Occupational Exposure (AIOE) Dataset | [GitHub Link](https://github.com/AIOE-Data/AIOE) | Measures how exposed different occupations are to AI, based on their tasks and required skills. Useful for plotting AI risk vs. job type/salary. |
| AI-Powered Job Market Insights | [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/ai-powered-job-market-insights) | Contains AI-related job listings with details like skills, company size, and automation risk. Useful for highlighting new job roles emerging from AI adoption. |
| Layoffs Dataset (2020–2023) | [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/theakhilb/layoffs-data-2022) | Tracks global layoffs with reasons (including AI/automation). Will be used for the timeline showing rise in AI-related layoffs. |
| Tech Layoff Tracker | [TrueUp Tracker](https://www.trueup.io/layoffs) | Real-time data on layoffs at tech companies. Helps reinforce the impact of AI in industries heavily adopting automation. |

These datasets are available publicly and will be used to build visualizations in Tableau. I will clean and preprocess them as needed, and any transformations will be documented in my project repo.

# Method and medium

For the final story, I’ll use **Shorthand** to organize the narrative and embed **Tableau Public** visualizations. The user will scroll through the story and encounter charts placed at key points to emphasize the message. This approach allows for a smooth storytelling experience with clean, interactive visuals.

If needed, I may use Canva or Figma to add some simple icons or illustrations, but the core data visualizations will be made in Tableau.

## AI acknowledgements

AI was used to help brainstorm the structure and clean up early drafts of this project outline, including identifying strong sources and suggesting a narrative arc. All final writing and organization was done by me, with support for edits and tone correction. All data analysis and visualization work will be completed independently.
