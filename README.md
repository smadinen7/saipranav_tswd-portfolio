# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
My name is Sai Pranav Madineni, and I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, pursuing a Master’s in Information Systems Management with a focus on Business Intelligence and Data Analytics. My background is in software engineering and data science, with experience in building full-stack applications and working with machine learning models. I am particularly passionate about leveraging data-driven insights to solve complex problems across industries, including finance, technology, and public policy.

# What I hope to learn
- I want to improve my ability to craft compelling data-driven stories that make complex insights more accessible and actionable for diverse audiences.
- I aim to refine my data visualization skills by learning best practices in color theory, layout, and chart selection to effectively present information.
- I am excited to explore various storytelling techniques and critique methodologies that will help me evaluate and enhance my own visualizations.
- I plan to leverage this course to build a strong portfolio showcasing my ability to communicate insights through data, which will be valuable for future job applications.
- After graduation, I aspire to work in data science and analytics, applying my skills to solve real-world challenges in industries such as finance, technology, and public policy.
- I hope to collaborate with classmates on creative data visualization projects and learn from their perspectives and experiences.
- I will be maintaining my portfolio on GitHub and following the GitHub markdown guide to format my projects professionally.
