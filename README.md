# TSWD-portfolio-templates
These portfolio templates are for setting up your Telling Stories with Data site.  Edit these pages and add new ones as needed.   
It's always helpful to keep track of your web URL.  Consider putting that somewhere on your page for easy reference:

# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
My name is Sai Pranav Madineni, and I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, pursuing a Master’s in Information Systems Management with a focus on Business Intelligence and Data Analytics. My background is in software engineering and data science, with experience in building full-stack applications and working with machine learning models. I am particularly passionate about leveraging data-driven insights to solve complex problems across industries, including finance, technology, and public policy.

# What I hope to learn
All the things - obviously. Maybe I want to make a list of all the things.  If so, I can do so in Markdown like this: 

1. List item #1
2. List item #2
3. List item #3

or...

- List item #1
- List item #2
- List item #3

# Examples
You can keep this section for stuff from in-class demos or your other work, or remove it.
