# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me
My name is Sai Pranav Madineni, and I am a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, pursuing a Master’s in Information Systems Management with a focus on Business Intelligence and Data Analytics. My background is in software engineering and data science, with experience in building full-stack applications and working with machine learning models. I am particularly passionate about leveraging data-driven insights to solve complex problems across industries, including finance, technology, and public policy.

# What I hope to learn
- I want to improve my ability to craft compelling data-driven stories that make complex insights more accessible and actionable for diverse audiences.
- I aim to refine my data visualization skills by learning best practices in color theory, layout, and chart selection to effectively present information.
- I am excited to explore various storytelling techniques and critique methodologies that will help me evaluate and enhance my own visualizations.
- I plan to leverage this course to build a strong portfolio showcasing my ability to communicate insights through data, which will be valuable for future job applications.
- After graduation, I aspire to work in data science and analytics, applying my skills to solve real-world challenges in industries such as finance, technology, and public policy.
- I hope to collaborate with classmates on creative data visualization projects and learn from their perspectives and experiences.

# Examples

## Assignment: [Visualizing Government Debt](visualizing-government-debt)
In this assignment, I analyzed government debt data and visualized debt-to-GDP ratios across multiple countries. I focused on designing a clear, comparative chart that made differences between countries easier to understand at a glance.

## Assignment 3&4: [Critique by Design](critique-by-design)
For this project, I selected a flawed existing data visualization and redesigned it to improve clarity, accessibility, and storytelling. I critiqued the original chart's weaknesses and applied better visualization principles to make the insights more actionable.

## Final project
My final project explores the impact of AI on the global job market, especially in the tech sector.  
- [Part I](final-project-part-one): Project proposal outlining the main research question, goals, and initial storyboard ideas.  
- [Part II](final-project-part-two): Developed initial wireframes and Tableau visualizations to prototype the key visual elements of the story.  
- [Part III](final-project-part-three): Completed a fully narrated, styled Shorthand story, analyzing AI-driven layoffs, industry adoption trends, and providing insights for future workforce resilience.

## AI acknowledgements
_I used AI to help refine and structure my writing in a more professional manner. The AI assisted in enhancing clarity, improving sentence flow, and ensuring that my responses were well-organized and aligned with the course requirements. However, all ideas, personal insights, and content were originally my own, and AI was used solely as a tool for drafting and refining the final text._
